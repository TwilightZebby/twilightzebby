He/Him

I am a British programmer who likes to play games, watch Doctor Who or Anime, and code stuff.
Additionally, I am also part of the Staff/Moderation Team behind Twitch Streamer [Dr1fterX](https://www.twitch.tv/dr1fterx)'s Twitch Chat and Discord Server - and a Bug Hunter for Discord in their [Discord Testers](https://dis.gd/bugs) Program.

I used to mainly focus in the language of JavaScript/NodeJS, and have made a *few* Discord Server/User Apps using [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). Such Apps include my own [EclipseMentions](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/EclipseMentionsBot), [Crimson Levels](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/CrimsonLevelsBot), [HomeCord](https://github.com/HomeCord/HomeCord), [UserStars](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/UserStars), [HeccBot (formally "MooBot"/"Actions Bot")](https://github.com/HeccBot/HeccBot), and other ones which are private. I've also helped Dr1fterX on his own Server Apps (dubbed "St1gBots") for his Discord Server.
