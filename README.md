I am a British programmer who likes to play games, watch Doctor Who or Anime, and code stuff.
Additionally, I am also part of the Staff/Moderation Team behind Twitch Streamer [Dr1fterX](https://www.twitch.tv/dr1fterx)'s Twitch and Discord Server.

I mainly focus in the language of JavaScript/NodeJS, and have made a *few* Discord Bots using [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). Such bots include my own private ones, [EclipseMentions](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/EclipseMentionsBot), and [Crimson Levels](https://top.gg/bot/657859837023092746). I've also helped Dr1fterX on his own Bots for his Server.
