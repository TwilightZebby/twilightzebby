He/Him

I am a British programmer who likes to play games, watch Doctor Who or Anime, and code stuff. Also demimale, gay, nerd, geek, and on a journey of rediscovery.
Additionally, I am also part of the Staff/Moderation Team behind Twitch Streamer [Dr1fterX](https://www.twitch.tv/dr1fterx)'s Twitch Chat and Discord Server; as well as a Bug Squasher on the official [Discord Testers Server](https://discord.gg/discord-testers) and one of the Sandwich Server members whom helped Discord make their ["Imagine a Place" short film](https://web.archive.org/web/20210725170051/youtube.com/watch?v=3xOkZ0_Rocs).

I mainly focus in the language of JavaScript/NodeJS, and have made a *few* Discord Bots using [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). Such bots include my own [EclipseMentions](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/EclipseMentionsBot), [Crimson Levels](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/CrimsonLevelsBot), and other ones which are private. I've also helped Dr1fterX on his own Bots (dubbed "St1gBots") for his Discord Server. Furthermore, I have also made the [House Trivia Bot](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/HouseTriviaBot) and [MooBot (formally "Actions Bot")](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/MooBot) for Dr1fterX's Discord.
