He/Him

I am a British programmer who likes to play games, watch Doctor Who or Anime, and code stuff. Also demimale, gay, nerd, and a geek.
Additionally, I am also part of the Staff/Moderation Team behind Twitch Streamer [Dr1fterX](https://www.twitch.tv/dr1fterx)'s Twitch Chat and Discord Server; and one of the Sandwich Server members whom helped Discord make their ["Imagine a Place" short film](https://web.archive.org/web/20210725170051/youtube.com/watch?v=3xOkZ0_Rocs).

I mainly focus in the language of JavaScript/NodeJS, and have made a *few* Discord Bots using [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). Such bots include my own [EclipseMentions](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/EclipseMentionsBot), [Crimson Levels](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/CrimsonLevelsBot), and other ones which are private. I've also helped Dr1fterX on his own Bots (dubbed "St1gBots") for his Discord Server. Furthermore, I have also made the [House Trivia Bot](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/HouseTriviaBot) for Dr1fterX's Discord Server, and [MooBot (formally "Actions Bot")](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/MooBot).

Outside of ClassicJS/NodeJS, I have also dabbled in other languages too; such as Java, PHP, C++, C#, and Python - although my current knowledge of those are very minimal due to only using them within the context of College and University.
